## Theoretical physicist with expetise in the immune system, complexity and network science. 

This is my personal site where I shall host a number of projects for all to see. I am currently looking for work in personalised medicine. You can find my CV and contact details here. 


## Publications
Over the course of my PhD I have written several first author publications 
1. _Modelling the interplay between the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio and the expression of MHC-I in tumours_ Here I define and study a model of the [T-cell response to tumours](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.185926v1)
2. _Vaccination with partial transmission and social distancing on contact networks_ I have also studied how differences in the immunity of individuals to an infectious disease affect the [risk and size of epidemics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06616)
3. _A precision dosing application for patients treated with docetaxel and G-CSF_: this was a poster [abstract](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/13_Supplement/228/668101/Abstract-228-A-precision-dosing-application-for) submitted to the Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2021, based on work completed during an internship with the oncoloygy consultancy Physiomics. 
4. _Self-interactions in gene regulatory networks support a multiplicity of attractors_ (in preparation)
