# About me

I am a theoretical physicist and am in the final stretch of writing my thesis _"Statistical mechanics of immunity from genes to populations"_. 
While studying Physics at the University of Manchester, I realised that while I loved (and still love!) physics, the problems that interested me 
were in the biological and medical sciences. Since that realisation I steered my Physics education in a direction that I felt would better prepare me for 
a career in the biomedical sector, while still standing out as a physicsist. During the final year of my MPhys at Manchester, I worked on improving 
precision in parameters that quantify water exchange through capillaries in the brain from MRI data. This work involved Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling. 

Leaving Manchester, I joined the [CANES CDT](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/noneqsys) (Cross-Disciplinary Approaches to Non-Equilibrium Systems Centre for Doctoral Training). This is a 1+3 year
program. The first year of this program was an MSc in Non-Equilibrium systems. When we think of some phemomena we wish to study, be it the spread of infectious diseases, 
the crash of financial markets, or the flocking behaviour seen in groups of certain animals, we can see that each of these pheneomena are not _closed_ systems. 
There are external factors that drive these systems, in a way that is not always quantifiable. Such systems are inherently _out-of-equilibrium_ and challenging to study.
It is the driving ethos of the CANES programme to address the study of non-equilibrium systems. 

After the MSc portion of the programme I began my PhD in the [Disordered Systems](https://dissyskcl.github.io) group at King's, under the supevision of Alessia Annibale and Franca Fraternali
and Alexander Mozeika. I am interested in the physics of _complex systems_. These are systems with many agents (these could be particles, cells, people, stocks...) which 
which interact with each other in a way which is difficult to know _a priori_. A good example is the spread of infectious diseases. We know that epidemics are caused 
by the disease transmitting from person to person, but we do not _know_ the actual network of social connections which this disease has passed along. Of course, we can 
measure and estimate a portion of this network, but this comes with its own set of problems. Instead one can get good knowledge about the statistics of such a network. 
How many people on average do we meet a day? How does this vary with age? Location? The question can then be asked, given these statistics, what happens to an infectious disease for a 
_typical_ realisation of the network describing interactions between people in a population. These types of questions can be answered using statistical mechanics, where we accept 
that our system is too complicated to model (for example) the actions and reactions of every individual agent. Instead, we look at a statistical description of the system. 
Given that the agents behave like this, with thes typical interactions, what does the system typically _do_. Using the previous example, given that people typically meet this many people
a day, given that they transmit the disease at this rate, and recover this quickly, how many people become infected before the disease stops spreading? 

In my case, I have used statistical mechanics to study the immune response to tumours, the impact of vaccinations which dampen but do not extinguish disease transmission, and gene regulatory networks. 
You can read about this over [here](./Publications.md). 


Now, I am looking for work in personalised healthcare. I have cut my chops in theoretical physics, developed a solid grounding in immunology, and have practical experience in the field. 
The future of medicine is digital, with personalised health care becoming ever more important as machine learning and artifical intelligence approaches improve. 
I believe my theoretical background and focus on rigourous results, will be of importance when desiging tools which provide individualised care based on machine learning processes.
